# Welcome to Pingyi Huo's Homepage

I am a researcher with a PhD in Computer Science from The Penn State University, where I was supervised by Dr. Vijaykrishnan Narayanan. My research focuses on the microarchitecture of cloud infrastructure, with a particular emphasis on CXL optimization, compute heterogeneity, and the optimization and resource scheduling of cloud application software.
